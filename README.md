# Analysing_Time_Spent_on_Social_Platform
In this project, we aim to analyze the average time spent by users on social media platforms. By studying this metric, we can gain a deeper understanding of user behavior and preferences, which can help social media companies enhance their user experience and tailor their content to better meet user needs. 

Through this analysis, we seek to answer questions such as:

What is the average time spent by users on social media platforms?
How does the average time spent vary across different demographics (age, gender, location)?

Social media platforms have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering a wide range of services from connecting with friends and family to consuming news and entertainment. One key metric that social media companies often track is the average time spent by users on their platforms. Understanding this metric can provide valuable insights into user engagement and platform usage patterns.
