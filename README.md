# Analysing_Time_Spent_on_Social_Platform
In this project, we aim to analyze the average time spent by users on social media platforms. By studying this metric, we can gain a deeper understanding of user behavior and preferences, which can help social media companies enhance their user experience and tailor their content to better meet user needs.
